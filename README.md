# Private Blockchain Project
In this project I created a private blockchain.  
I implemented the classes defining the data structure for the blocks and the
chain.  
In order to be able to persist my blochchain I used LevelDB.
## Getting Started
1. Download or clone the repository
2. Install project dependencies: `npm install`
3. Test the functionalities: `node simpleChain.js`

## Resources
- [LevelDB](http://leveldb.org/): to persist the data
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [crypto-js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/crypto-js): for SHA256 cryptographic
function
